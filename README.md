# AXATechTest

This is a project for the AXA Tech Test. It contains the two classes required for the modelling of the transcript and depression data. These classes ate transcriptLLM and depressionPrediction respectively.

All other scripts are drafts and are not part of the final submission.

PDFs of the final submission are also included in the repository, as well as a pdf of the presentation slides. They are in the PDF directory.
I also included tests in the tests folder and a requirements.txt file for the dependencies.
